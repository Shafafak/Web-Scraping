# Web-Scraping

This repository consists of my web-scraping projects.

1.WEB SCRAPING IMDB TOP SERIES

Here I used python BeautifulSoup library along with Pandas and Requests to extract top 250 web series from IMDB all time list.

2.WEB SCRAPING EPL DATA FROM FBref.com

In this data science project, i Have expanded upon the previous web scraping project. Data is scraped from FBref.com. I initially started by scraping the standings webpage to get the tags that connect the teams to web pages containing their data. I have used the Python requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. As with the previous project, the scraped data is put in a pandas DataFrame. Lastly, I have converted pandas DataFrame object to a comma-separated values (CSV) file that can be reused later.
